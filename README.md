# Tic-Tac-Toe
(Part of The Odin Project) A Tic Tac Toe game you can play in your browser!

## Check list
- [x] make a playable tic tac toe board with javascript
- [x] practice factory functions, module pattern and object constructors
- [x] none or very few global variables
- [x] display player tokens on the DOM
- [x] players cannot place a token where there is one already
- [x] players can choose their name before the game
- [x] add a start/restart button

 ## Things to fix (one day) 
- The turns do not work how I want them to (and it's making everything worse)
- You can still play after the game is over (if you close the end game message to look at the board), and get more points
- The way I check for ties is ghastly

## Things to add ()
- Something to make the loser start the next game (at this point player 1 always starts)
- Resize board
- Choose tou token at player creation
